# Real-Time Parking Space Monitoring

## Project Overview
This project utilizes Computer Vision techniques, leveraging the OpenCV library, to develop a real-time parking space monitoring system. The system analyzes video streams from cameras installed over parking lots to detect empty mathematically and occupied spaces, helping drivers quickly find available spots and optimize parking lot usage.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Monitors parking spaces in real-time.
- **Space Availability**: Identifies and marks available parking spaces.
- **Efficient Parking**: Reduces time spent searching for parking spots.
- **Video Stream Processing**: Processes live video feeds from cameras.
